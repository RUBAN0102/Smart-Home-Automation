# Smart Home Automation System – ESP32

## Overview
This project implements an IoT-based smart home automation system using the ESP32
microcontroller. The system enables real-time monitoring of environmental parameters
and remote control of household appliances through a cloud-connected dashboard.

The project was developed as a functional hardware–software prototype focusing on
sensor interfacing, embedded firmware development, and IoT system integration.
