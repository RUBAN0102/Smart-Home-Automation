# PCB Design – Planned Version

## Overview
This directory is reserved for the custom PCB design of the Smart Home Automation
System. The PCB is planned to replace the breadboard prototype to improve system
reliability, compactness, and manufacturability.

## Current Status
- ❌ PCB not yet designed
- 🛠 Planned as next development phase

## Planned PCB Features
- ESP32-based controller section
- Regulated power supply for sensors and relays
- On-board connectors for all sensors
- Relay driver circuitry with isolation
- Compact form factor suitable for enclosure

## Tools to be Used
- Altium Designer
- Standard DRC/ERC checks
- Manufacturing-ready outputs (Gerber, BOM)

## Note
All PCB files will be added only after the design is fully completed and verified.
